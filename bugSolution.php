To address this, ensure explicit key management. For sequential numeric keys, use `array_push()`:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["someKey"] = "someValue";
$myArray[123] = "anotherValue";

//Correct way to add elements to maintain sequence.
array_push($myArray, "YetAnotherValue");
array_push($myArray, "AnotherValue");

print_r($myArray);

//Alternatively, explicit key management:
$myArray2 = [];
$myArray2[0] = "value1";
$myArray2[1] = "value2";
$myArray2[2] = "value3";
print_r($myArray2);
```

This corrected code explicitly controls key assignment.  This will prevent unintended array structures and ensure consistent key ordering. Using `array_push()` for sequential numeric keys is recommended over relying on implicit key generation.
