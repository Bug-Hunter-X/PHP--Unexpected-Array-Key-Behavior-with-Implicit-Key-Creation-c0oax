# PHP Array Key Quirks: Implicit Key Creation

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to how arrays handle keys when they're not explicitly defined. The `bug.php` file shows code where attempts to increment numeric keys implicitly will fail to produce the expected sequence. The `bugSolution.php` offers a solution by using explicit key management or `array_push()` for sequential numeric keys.

This example highlights the necessity of clear key management in PHP to avoid unexpected array behavior and potential logic errors in your applications.  The implicit key creation can lead to unexpected results when expecting arrays with sequential integer keys. Always explicitly manage your array keys to avoid such issues.
